def right_justify(s):
# Function will print string so that its last letter is in column 70.
# Takes one argument, s. s will be assigned 'monty' to print.
    print(65 * ' ' + s)
# because monty contains 5 letters, there must be 65 spaces in front so its last letter ends in column 70 (70-5=65)
right_justify('monty')
# The function will return the string, which in this case ('monty') is not a value.
